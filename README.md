# UTBridgeCommands

Usage: Just dock at one of your Capships, look at the Direction of some PoI/Objects, Press the Sector Map Hotkey - and instead of the usual Sector Map you fet a Command Menu to give the Ship you are currently on Commands related to the Objects you are looking at
For better usage an updated Version of my Skunk Removal/Viewing Platform Micro-Mod has been included.
Commands available:
1 - Follow Ships
2 - Advanced Commands (independent of Target: Hold Pos; follow Skunk; Withdraw Battle; Patrol Zone)
3 - Attack - If no Enemies were selected it gives the possibility to Attack friendlies
4 - Move to Zone/Sector/Cluster
5 - Move to Station (Planned: bring up Trade Menu instead or something like this)
6 - Fly in this Direction

Each Option presents up to 6 Objects for the selected Action, if only one is found it will be selected immediately, otherwise the exact Object is asked for. (except for attack friendlies, this will always require a second confirmation)
To be included in the List Objects have to be in Radar Range of the Ship. For Command 1 and 3 Big Objects are preffered so small ships will be omited if 7 Objects or more are found.
For better Differentiation between Objects and Player Info a Distiance Indicator is now in front of the Object Name.
You can also Select other Zones and Sectors if they are known to you (and you know their Direction ;) ) - the angle for detection are far bigger than for Objects so the rough direction is enough. for example looking anywhere on the Moon in Albion selects both Sectors inside.
To fly to another Cluster select the Gate connecting the current Zone with it.
